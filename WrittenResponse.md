	* Functions- These are groups of code that result in specific activities that the coder wants done when they plug in needed information in the specified spots. The benefit of using a function is that is can be used multiple times with a variety of inputs depending on how general or specific you create it.

	* Parameters-These are used within a function. The purpose of a parameter is to allow the coder to be able to use a variety of inputs in place of which ever parameter they entered.

	* Arguments- These are what the function will react to. The Parameter is a placeholder for an argument.

	* `if` statements- These are functions that act as logical statements for the code to work through. This is used when multiple conditions must be observed in your work. This works in relation to ThEn statements. "IF" something works out the coder requests a specific output. But if the "IF" does not work out the coder must create a "THEN" statement or multiples until all conditions are covered.
